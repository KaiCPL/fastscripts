# fastscripts
Fast JS scripts realising all needed functionality without any JS framework needed

*window.Y* implements eventListener and DOM element accessing; other functions are operating with DOM-tree itself.
Included AJAX implementation on XMLHTTP-Factory model to use in any browser, extendable with headers and private error/success functions passed as arguments.

If scope is free, fastscript can be defined as HTMLElement prototypes and used freely. As this is single-module implementation, it doesn't touch prototypes.
